# 👋 Hi, I'm Seungmin Lee (Will)

iOS Developer focused on building **efficient, scalable, and user-centered applications**.

I constantly challenge myself to improve **performance, architecture, and user experience** —  
always asking:

> “How can this be faster?”  
> “How can this be simpler?”  
> “How can this feel better for the user?”

## 🚀 About Me

I am an iOS developer who deeply cares about:

- ⚡ Performance optimization and runtime efficiency  
- 🧠 Clean, scalable architecture design  
- 🎯 Detail-oriented UX refinement  
- 🔬 Continuous experimentation with modern technologies  

I am not afraid of adopting new tools or paradigms if they improve productivity, maintainability, or user experience.  
From architectural transitions to concurrency models, I actively evaluate and integrate better approaches into real projects.

## 🎯 My Development Philosophy

I believe great apps are built on:

- Thoughtful architecture  
- Measurable performance improvements  
- Clean and maintainable code  
- Relentless iteration on UX  

Technology evolves quickly —  
and I aim to evolve with it.
