# 👋 Hi, I'm Seungmin Lee (Will)

iOS Developer focused on building **efficient, scalable, and user-centered applications**.

I constantly challenge myself to improve **performance, architecture, and user experience** —  
always asking:

> “How can this be faster?”  
> “How can this be simpler?”  
> “How can this feel better for the user?”
